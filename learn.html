          Once you are on the dashboard of your studio account, simply click on the red "plus" to get started.
          All of the projects you have made previously can be found here aswell.</h1>

      <h1>Once you click on the plus you will be given 3 options. For the sake of this guide, I've chosen
          studio, but your choice here will depend on what software you are using to create the AR experiences.
          Once you have selected your tool, click on the 'Next Step' button.</h1>

      <h1>On this next page, you will basically be chosing the trigger for you AR experience. The top option;
          'ZapCode' is the trigger we will be using today, and this is the trigger you, and any others will be scanning to
           view your AR experience. ZapWorks also provides other options like QR code scanning and Deep Links.
           These options would be useful for viewing your AR experience without needing the ZapWorks app on your phone.</h1>

          On this page you can add labels, and view various other pieces of information about your creation. The rest of the
          work is done in the ZapWorks Studio app. The app makes linking a creation to a trigger really easy, and after you've
          made your experience all it takes is the push of a few buttons to finalise.</h1>
